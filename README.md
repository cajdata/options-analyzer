# options-analyzer
An end-to-end Python web app that uses Tesseract OCR to parse option chain screenshots and analyze key fields (bid, ask, IV, Greeks). Built with FastAPI and a minimal HTML/JS frontend, it demonstrates basic OCR parsing and a toy scoring engine for educational use. Not financial advice.
